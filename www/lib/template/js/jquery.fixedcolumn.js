  /**
   * A simple utility to fix the width of all or specific column(s)
   * of a <table>.
   * You should use this with a proper TABLE structure with a THEAD.
   * It will find the first row (TR) of the table, preferably in the THEAD
   * section and calculate and set the width of the column(s) specified
   * in options.
   * Please make sure your table cell content within TD or TH,
   * is wrapped by an inline-block element, since we cannot set the width of
   * TD or TH elements. For example:
   *
   * <table>
   *   <thead>
   *     <tr>
   *       <th>
   *         <span class="wrapper" style="display:inline-block">
   *         ...
   *         </span>
   *       </th>
   *       ...
   *
   * USAGE:
   *   $("#mytable").fixedcolumn();           // fix width for 1st column
   *   $("#mytable").fixedcolumn({all:true}); // fix width for all columns
