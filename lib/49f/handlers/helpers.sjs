/**
 * Currently there is no way of passing back metadata of a handler's to_http_response,
 * such as headers and status, on acre.include.
 *
 * We use a Javascript abnomally of passing back a String object as the body with headers and status
 * as expando attributes.
 *
 * var content = acre.include("some/handled/file");
 * if (content.headers) {
 *   //acre.response.set_header(...)
 * }
 * if (content.status) {
 *   //acre.response.status = content.status
 * }
 *
 * Passing back String objects also assures that it will get serialized into a
 * native "string" particulary when using JSON.stringify.
