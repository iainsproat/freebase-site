      <p>Metaweb Technologies, Inc. welcomes you and is pleased to offer the Freebase service. The following terms and conditions (the "Terms of Service") govern your access to and use of the Freebase website ("Site"), any services provided by Metaweb through the Site ("Service") and any information, text, graphics, or other materials appearing on the Site or Service ("Content"). By accessing or using this Site, Content, or Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. </p>
      <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service from time to time.  If this occurs, we will provide prominent notice of it on the Freebase website. The revised terms will take effect when they are posted. You acknowledge and agree that if you use the Site and/or Service at any time after the Terms of Service have changed, Metaweb will treat your use as acceptance of the updated Terms of Service.</p>
      <h2>1. User Eligibility </h2>
      <p>In consideration of your use of the Service, you represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction.</p>
      <h2>2. General Use and Storage Policies </h2>
      <p>You acknowledge that we may establish general practices and limits concerning access to and/or use of the Site, Content, and Service. You agree that we have no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store or display any content that you contribute to the Content, Site, or Service.</p>
      <h2>3. User Contributed Content</h2>
      <p>As outlined in the <a href="${h.fb_url('/policies/licensing')}">Licensing Policy</a>, Freebase users can upload Data, Schema, Descriptions, Code and Media Files to the Site or Service.  Any contributions to Freebase are subject to the terms set out in the Licensing Policy.</p>
      <h2>4. Republishing </h2>
      <p>You may copy, modify and redistribute Content in accordance with the guidelines posted on the Site or Service provided that you comply with the licenses that are presented with such Content.  See our <a href="${h.fb_url('/policies/licensing')}">Licensing Policy</a> for more information.</p>
      <h2>5. API Use and Application Hosting </h2>
      <p>We provide access to portions of the Site and Service through an API thereby enabling people to build applications on top of the Freebase platform. The API and Application Hosting Services are provided free of charge for up to <strong>100,000 (one hundred thousand) calls per day <u>per person or organization</u></strong>, which we believe will meet the needs of the vast majority of developers. You agree not to use multiple IP addresses or any other means to get around this limitation. If you require higher volume API use for your site or service, please contact us at <a href="mailto:partners@metaweb.com">partners@metaweb.com</a> to discuss an alternate arrangement. </p>
      <p>For purposes of this Terms of Service, any use of the API constitutes use of the Site and Service. You agree only to use the API as outlined in the documentation provided by us on the Site.</p>
      <h2>6. Data Dumps </h2>
      <p>In addition to providing access to Freebase via the Site and the API, Metaweb provides a free, downloadable version of the Data in Freebase every three months. These files, referred to as "Data Dumps,", constitute a snapshot of the Data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. They can be found at <a href="http://download.freebase.com/datadumps">http://download.freebase.com/datadumps</a>.</p>
      <p>For purposes of this Terms of Service, any use of the Data Dumps constitutes use of the Site and Service. You agree only to use the Data Dumps as outlined in the documentation provided by us on the Site.</p>
      <h2>7. Content Linked to by Freebase Users and Developers </h2>
      <p>The inclusion of any link on the Site, Service or Content does not imply that we endorse, recommend or are affiliated with the linked organization or company, or the content, product or services on or available from the linked website. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your access to and/or use of any such linked websites.</p>
      <h2>8. Registration and Password </h2>
      <p>In order to use the Site or Service, you may be required to register and to select a username and password, as well as provide an email address and limited information about yourself. In such a case, you will provide us with complete, accurate and current information and will promptly update such information as necessary to ensure that it remains complete, accurate and current. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if we determine (or have a reasonable basis to believe) that your registration information is, at the time of registration or thereafter, incomplete, inaccurate or no longer current. If you are required to register, you will designate an email address and receive (or choose) a username and/or password. In such case, you will accept responsibility for any use of the Service under your username, email address and/or password. You will be responsible for safeguarding the password and you agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You agree to take sole responsibility for any activities or actions under your password, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password.</p>
      <h2>9. Advertisement </h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to support the Service through the use of advertisements and promotions. In consideration of Metaweb granting you access to and use of the Service, you agree that Metaweb may place such advertising on the Service, including on pages consisting primarily of user-contributed content. </p>
      <h2>10. Privacy Policy </h2>
      <p>We respect the privacy of others. These Terms of Service incorporate the terms of the Freebase Privacy Policy, which may be found at <a href="${h.fb_url('/policies/privacy')}">${h.fb_url(true, '/policies/privacy')}</a>.</p>
      <h2>11. Copyright Policy </h2>
      <p>We respect the copyrights of others and expect Freebase users to do the same. Unauthorized copying, modification, distribution, public display or public performance of a copyrighted work is an infringement of the copyright holder's rights. You agree to comply with the terms of the Freebase Copyright Policy, which may be found at <a href="${h.fb_url('/policies/copyright')}">${h.fb_url(true, '/policies/copyright')}</a> and acknowledge that we will, in accordance with the Copyright Policy, terminate the account of any user who uses the Site or the Service repeatedly to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.</p>
