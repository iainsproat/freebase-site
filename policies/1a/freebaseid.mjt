      <p>
        Freebase ID is an authentication system that allows you to sign in to multiple websites using
        a single username and password. Create your account once and use it to sign in to any site
        that accepts Freebase ID.
      </p>
      
      <a name="q1"><h2 class="question">What sites use Freebase ID?</h2></a>
      <p>
        Freebase ID is used by sites that were built using free data sets and developer tools from Freebase.
      </p>
      
      <a name="q2"><h2 class="question">What is Freebase?</h2></a>
      <p>
        Freebase is an open database of the world's information. It is built by the community and for the community,
        which means anyone can browse it, contribute information to it, or build applications on top of it.
        Freebase data sets cover dozens of popular categories, like music, movies, books, people, locations,
        companies, sports, science, and more.  Already, Freebase contains millions of freely licensed facts
        and images and is growing daily thanks to the efforts of a passionate, global user community.
        Websites built on top of the Freebase platform are called "Freebase apps."  They include a wide range of social
        networks, recommendation engines, and reference sites, and they all make use the the rich, open data in Freebase.
      </p>
      
      <a name="q3"><h2 class="question">How do Freebase apps share my content?</h2></a>
      <p>
        Certain Freebase apps allow users to contribute content. For example, a site for beer lovers might
        allow its users to add new beers to the database, or a social network for movie fans might let
        its users rate and recommend movies.  When users contribute content in this manner, it gets
        recorded in Freebase so that other Freebase apps can use it, and it is attributed in Freebase to that user.  
        Private data (e.g., email addresses, passwords) is never made public, nor is information about what you have viewed.
